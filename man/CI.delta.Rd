\title{Estimate the interaction index as well as its confidence interval using delta method for fixed ratio design}
\usage{
CI.delta(d1, e1, d2, e2, d12, e12, d2.d1, E, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{d1}{dose for drug 1 where drug 2 has dose equal to 0}

\item{e1}{corresponding scaled response for drug 1, must between 0 and 1}

\item{d2}{dose for drug 2 where drug 1 has dose equal to 0}

\item{e2}{corresponding scaled response for drug 2, must between 0 and 1}

\item{d12}{the sum of doses from drug 1 and drug 2 when both drugs are administered}

\item{e12}{corresponding scaled response when both drugs are administered}

\item{d2.d1}{the ratio of the ray design. This is the fixed ratio of dose 2 divided by dose 1}

\item{E}{a vector of responses (between 0 and 1) where IAI and confidence interval are to be computed from.}

\item{alpha}{significance level of confidence interval}
}
\value{
a data frame with columns IAI, IAI.low, IAI.up, E, dx1 (corresponding dose of drug 1), dx2 (corresponding dose of drug 1), 
 dx12 (corresponding dose of combined drug, same as definition of d12)

\description{
this code is extracted from the source code distributed at https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/
Two versions are included in the source code: CI_IIV2 2008.SSC and CI_IIV2.SSC
At first we implement CI_IIV2.SSC; this gives wider CI band; so we decide to use  CI_IIV2 2008.SSC. Further, CI_IIV2 2008.SSC has
a more recent date and thus most updated.
